This is an android application used for removing SMS sent from certain numbers which you can set by yourself.

For me, I used it to auto-remove the SMS sent from 10010100 which the Unicom sent AD everyday.

Note:
It use the ContentProvider to operate sms database, and it would be disable in some kinds of android mobile phone which not
provide the "content://sms" Content Provider.

Enjoying it!
